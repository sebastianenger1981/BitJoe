Mutellad and MuWI Readme
========================

Mutellad and muwi offer an unsecure client/server and web-interface to mutella
(http://mutella.sourceforge.net/). 

"mutellad" works as a wrapper around mutella. It creates a socket on the 
system which must be defined in mutellad and muwi. As mutellad starts mutella 
for the current user, it will use his configuration.
See also the INSTALL and the CONFIG section.

"muwi" is the client for the mutellad. Use it to communicate with mutella. 
It can also be run as cgi. Then it returns a HTML Page. 
Some commands are filtered because of mutella's unsafe "system" command. Take
a look at the code. It's not too difficult.
See also the INSTALL and the CONFIG section.

"mu-conadapt" is now obsolete. Is is implemented in mutellad.
mutellad can automatically adapts the MaxConnections of mutella.
It pings a host (default: heise.de) that should be near to you (maybe your DNS)
and calculates the optimal number of MaxConnections and sent them to mutella.



INSTALL:
========
Unpack the tar.gz file, copy mutellad to a location you like. Copy muwi to 
your cgi-bin path and edit the path where muwi can find the config file 
(~/.mutella/mutelladrc). You have to write p.e. /home/xyz/.mutella/mutelladrc.
Maybe you have to give read rights for all users to .mutella dir.
If you like a favicon, copy muwi.ico to your public_html dir and edit the path
in the config file.



CONFIG:
=======
1) Run mutella, so that ~/.mutella directory will be created. Exit mutella.

2) Run the mutellad (./mutellad or ./mutellad --debug for test purpose).
   Mutellad should have generated a default mutelladrc in ~/.mutella/

3) If you want to use muwi as cgi or if you want that someone else on your 
   machine can use muwi in a terminal, set permission for other to read 
   ~/.mutella/ and ~/.mutella/mutelladrc . Maybe your HOME directory must be
   executable for other too.

4) Edit ~/.mutella/mutelladrc by hand or use muwi to do this. 



CONFIG-EXAMPLES:
================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) First run of mutella.

$ /usr/local/bin/mutella
IMPORTANT EVENT:
  Directory '~/.mutella' does not exist and will be created
IMPORTANT EVENT:
  Directory '~/mutella' does not exist and will be created
IMPORTANT EVENT:
  Directory '~/mutella/part' does not exist and will be created

Creating default '~/.mutella/termrc' file
Edit it to modify Mutella startup behaviour

You are currently using Mutella v0.4
  Enjoy!

> exit
bye

$

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Run the mutella-deamon. It starts mutella.

$ ./mutellad
$ ls -la /tmp/mutella.sock
srwxrwxrwx    1 user     user            0 Feb  5 16:49 /tmp/mutellad.sock

$

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to see the communication with the clients start the mutellad
with the  --debug  option. Then the server won't fork to the background.

$ ./mutellad --debug

Started mutella on PID: 21167

You are currently using Mutella v0.3.3
  Enjoy!
mutella < help
[...]

$

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Set right permissions

$ chmod o+x /home/mutella
$ chmod o+r /home/mutella/.mutella
$ chmod o+r /home/mutella/.mutella/mutelladrc
$ 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------





MORE EXAMPLES:
==============

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
mutellad supports the "restart" command send by muwi. If receiving this 
command, mutellad sends "exit" to mutella and starts himself again!

$ ./mutellad --debug

[...]

mutella < exit
mutella > Sending answer of 19 bytes.
Restarting mutella and mutellad!
Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default.

Started mutella on PID: 21192

You are currently using Mutella v0.3.3
  Enjoy!

[...]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All users that can access that socket from a terminal may issue commands to 
mutella via muwi:

$ ./muwi help
 help
Available comands:
==================
help    Displays a help message. Type 'Help <command>' for more specific info
?       Synonym for 'Help'
exit    Exits Mutella
info    Displays various information regarding current network activities
hosts   Displays current content of the hosts cache
find    Adds a query to the search list
list    Lists current searches
[...]


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run muwi as a cgi, point your browser to the url where you installed it:
http://your.domain/cgi-bin/muwi
If this fails, read the webserver error_log.

TIPS
====

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
get   3) `Italiensk%20for%20nybegynnere/Italiensk for nybegynnere divx 1of1.a

vi' 704M REF:15

If you get somthing like this ( I mean such a wrapped line in muwi cgi) just 
edit the TerminalCols Variable of mutella to something like 150 (default: 80)
