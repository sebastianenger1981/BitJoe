INSTALLATION:
Requires: PHP4, MYSQL 4.0+

No real exciting installation procedures.  Create a database in mysql
(in the mysql client, do "CREATE DATABASE gcache" where gcache is the
name you desire to call it). Then run the schema to create the tables
(mysql gcache <phpgnucacheii.schema). I usually like to add user
access to this database so that I don't have root doing anything. 
(in mysql do "use gcache" or whatever you named it, then do
"GRANT ALL ON * TO apache IDENTIFIED BY 'secretpassword';")

If you know what your doing, and can afford to be a little risque with
your database, use the expert.phpgnucacheii.schema. It helps make things
run about 20% faster.

Then put the php script where you want it and edit the config info at 
the top.

I STRONGLY SUGGEST you use a CNAME to your web server such as 
gwcii.yourwebsite.org. Even though the files exists on 
www.yourwebsite.org, if you ever want to take it down again all you'll
have to do is delete the CNAME.

CONFIGURATION:

Not a lot here to configure...

In the config/config.inc file, edit:
MY_URL: set that to what you want the rest of the world to know you as.
MYSQL_SERVER: your sql server...
MYSQL_LOGIN: your sql login... such as apache.
MYSQL_PASSWORD: your sql password (beginning to see a pattern?)
MYSQL_DATABASE: your sql database name
MAX_HOSTS: the maximum hosts or urls to reply with to a get, urlfile, or hostfile request.
MAX_AGE: the maximum age that any entry in the host/url table should be in minutes.
URL_VALIDATION: by default, this script validates each url request with a ping submission 
                to that cache. Some free php sites (like lycos) disable features that make
                that possible. Set this to false if your php server doesn't have fsockopen.
DEFAULT_NET: if you're hosting for a specific network, you may want to change this.
FSOCK_TIMEOUT: timeout for trying to validate an url. On _most_ networks, 10 seconds should be a big plenty.
DELAYED_WRITE: if your mysql installation support this, it makes sql transactions MUCH faster.

* Run the populate.client.php script to populate the client database. (either run "php populate.client.php" or just use the url.

Latest versions should be around at http://gwcii.sourceforge.net
