Changes:
2.1.0 Randomized the results from get, hostfile, and urlfile requests to return a 
	random MAXHOSTS from the last MAXHOSTS*2 to prevent poisoning of the 
	caches from commercial organizations implementing illegal tactics to 
	try to protect their clients copyrights. Also added restrictions to 
	prevent the script from hammering other caches with pings. Our script will 
	not connect to the same URL more than once per hour now.
2.0.0 The numbering scheme seems odd because I didn't know what I was doing
	while populating the cvs tree on sourceforge, but it's the first release
	cadidate. Added the stat page written by by Nicholas Venturella 
	<nick2588[at]fastmail.fm>, then modified it to not only display more 
	actual client names for the client codes, but also to link to those
	client's web sites. Heavily improved the mysql data structure and
	database queries to improve speed.
0.5.10 turned off default errors and warnings in php
0.5.9 fix to prevent shareaza bogus caches from spamming non-verified (lycos)
	cache lists.
0.5.8 used examples from php.net's documentation to get the sender's IP address
	even when behind a transparent proxy server for lycos free users again.
	Now ip updates work on lycos servers.
0.5.7 learned how http requests really work (more than I ever wanted to know) and
	now I've fixed the GET requests to work correctly
0.5.6 added another link to the menu bar, and moved them into a define.
	Implemented timeouts for fsock calls. define FSOCK_TIMEOUT in config.inc
0.5.5 too quick on the release. now active host checking will make a gwc1 a
	gwc1 even if the client says, "network=anythingelse"
0.5.4 fixed bug where G2 clients speaking G2 but offering GWC1 caches were
	being put into the gnutella2 network
0.5.3 fixed some versioning stuff and moved config to a config file to make
	administering multiple sites easier
0.5.2 added the ability to disable url validation for lycos free website users
0.5.1 added a link to Jon Atkins webcache scan report (thanks Frosty192)
0.5.0 first beta release
