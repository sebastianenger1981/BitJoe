Revision history for Perl extension Sort::Array.

2001-08-25 / 0.26

	File permission fixed, now anybody can extract the archive, not
	only the user 'root'.

2001-08-23 / 0.25

	Changed the Discard_Duplicates() function to discard duplicates
	and only sort the array if wished. You can set <sorting> to
	'asending', 'desending' or let them empty to disable sorting.

	Some misspelling corrected.

2001-08-17 / 0.24

	Error codes are no longer returned in an array (that array that
	contains the sorted Data). $Sort::Array::error is used with the
	code instead.

	- First beta-release, non-public
